// Ported from keycard-tech/shell-units web/ur.js at tag 20261112 (MIT).

// UR framing as the Shell actually speaks it: `UR:DEV-AUTH/<bytewords>`.
//
// The payload is bytewords minimal: two lowercase letters per byte plus a four byte CRC-32 that both
// sides verify before reading the contents. Not base32 — digits are outside the bytewords alphabet,
// and a payload with the wrong encoding is dropped on both ends without a message, which shows up as
// a device that simply will not scan.
//
// Single-part only. A response is far below the size at which a message would ever be split, so a
// fountain decoder here would be dead code, and dead code in a verifier is worse than no code.

// The reference bytewords implementation, from the organisation that wrote the spec the Shell's
// firmware follows. Its /bytewords entry point is the only part of the UR package this page needs:
// the CBOR of a response is read by cbor.ts, where the checks are the point.

// The device folds the type label case-insensitively and tolerates any case in the bytewords body,
// but it emits uppercase type and lowercase body, so that is what this produces too.
